- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jh4ir1612
- 👀 I’m interested in web development (frontend and backend), mobile applications (Android/iOS) and systems integration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Flask/Django), JavaScript (React/Node.js) and I'm exploring Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to creating RESTful APIs, interactive user interfaces, or applications that solve real-world problems.
